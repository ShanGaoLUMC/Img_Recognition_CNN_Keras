# Application of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for happy face image recognition in Keras
This script is a **self-summarizing** version for completing the happy-face photo recognition project of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. This script has been tested and it works well on my local machine. In order to do so, I downloaded the necessary project files from the course kernel, and installed the Anaconda Python 3.6. Keras’s backend engine Tensorflow is first installed under Anaconda virtual environment with Python set to version 3.5 . Then I used pip to install Keras and other python libraries in the same virtual environment.

### Skills to develop:
* Implement a CNN using high-level neural networks API Keras, which has the following steps:
  * Create the model which includes convolutional, pooling and fully-connected layers.
  * Compile the model by calling model.compile(optimizer = "...", loss = "...", metrics = ["accuracy"]).
  * Train the model on train data by calling model.fit(x = ..., y = ..., epochs = ..., batch_size = ...).
  * Test the model on test data by calling model.evaluate(x = ..., y = ...).
